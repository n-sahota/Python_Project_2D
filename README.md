How conserved are the human APP and APLP sequences, and are their E2 dimerization regions structurally distinct?

Scientific Hypothesis: If APLP1 and APP have conserved sequence homology (as determined by MSA) and don't differ in their E2 regions, then considering APLP1 as a potential biomarker for amyloid beta plaque investigation could be a further avenue for improving models of Alzheimer's Disease.

Files to be familar with:
APP (human, dog, pig, and chicken): Each of these fasta files contain a single, similarly sized isoform of amyloid precursor protein in different organisms. We use these files to perform a MSA to compare APLP1 to APP. 

APLP1(human): A fasta file containing a single isoform of amyloid precursor like protein 1 in humans, it is similar in size to the APP sequences, making analysis easier. 

Unaligned= Containes all of the fasta sequences

Aligned= The output of MAFFT MSA
